# Ecological Niche Modelling: Beetles #

Due to the size of some files, **you will need to download the materials from this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gl0OwvbnfhQujh0qFIsPTsD2upmat6tc?usp=sharing)**

You can either download the full folder or the Zip file within it. If you download the zip file (is faster and lighter to download), you can unzip by right-clicking on the file and selecting the *unzip* option.
