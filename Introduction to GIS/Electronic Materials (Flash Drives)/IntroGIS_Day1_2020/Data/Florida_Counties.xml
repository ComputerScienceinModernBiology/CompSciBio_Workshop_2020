            <attraccr>The polygon attributes were not checked but were assumed to be correct from the original DEP data. Accuracy was estimated at approaching 100% as of May 2000. In December 2003, a domain was created for the attribute 'COUNTY' named dCOUNTY. The code was the value in the field and the description was the name of the County. This was used to validate the attributes. Errors, if any, were corrected in ArcMap 8.3.</attraccr>
        </attracc>
        <logic>The final product was checked against the source material. The Mapping and GIS section of the Southwest Florida Water Management District corrected any errors found.</logic>

            <horizpa>
                <horizpar>Accuracy should meet accuracy standards for a 1:2,000,000 scale map, +/- 1000 meters. In December 2003, the following Topolgy Rules were created and validated for the feature classes in the State County feature dataset: State County region must not overlap. State County region must be covered by State County boundary lines. The Cluster Tolerance was set at 0.005 meters. Any errors that were found were inspected and corrected using ArcMap 8.3.</horizpar>

                <procdesc>The UNIX compressed file was downloaded from the DEP ftp site. The file was uncompressed using the UNIX uncompress command. The export file was imported using the ArcInfo IMPORT command. The fuzzy tolerance was set to .001 and polygon topology was created using the BUILD command. The coverage was projected from ALBERS to UTM using the PROJECT command with the projection parameters listed below. The BUILD command was then used to recreate polygon and create arc topology. The ArcInfo commands ADDITEM and DROPITEM were used to modify the polygon attribute table (PAT) and arc attribute table (AAT). The following items were added to the PAT: COUNTY, CNTYNAME, DATESTAMP. The following items were dropped from the PAT: MAJOR1, MINOR1, MAJOR2, MINOR2, NAME. The following items were added to the AAT: COASTBND, DATESTAMP. The REGIONDISSOLVE command was used to create a region subclass called COUNTY. The following projection file was used: INPUT PROJECTION ALBERS UNITS METERS DATUM HPGN PARAMETERS 24 0 0.000 31 30 0.000 -84 0 0.000 24 0 0.000 400000.00000 0.00000 OUTPUT PROJECTION UTM ZONE 17 UNITS METERS DATUM HPGN PARAMETERS END</procdesc>

                <procdesc>In November and December 2003, an enterprise geodatabase was designed and implemented. Coverages were converted into feature classes using ArcCatalog 8.3. The feature classes were created new in a feature dataset, with column names, shape type, grid size, and projection information defined during creation. An X/Y Domain and Precision were set at MinX: -700,000; MinY: 2,000,000; Precision: 1000. Z-Values were set at MinZ: -20; Precision: 1000. The Grid Tile Size is 2,147,483.465. Data was then loaded into the feature classes from the coverages using the 'Load Data' tool in ArcCatalog 8.3. Topology and attributes were validated whenever possible. See Attribute Accuracy and Positional Accuracy for attribute domains used for attribute validation and topology rules used for positional validation, respectively.</procdesc>
