# Course: Introduction to Python (Part II)

## **Welcome to our workshop's repository for Introduction to Python (Part II)!**

This readme is a subset of the one you found in the main page. You'll see listed only the required software for this course, and corresponding links to download them.

In the folders above you'll find the necessary materials for the *Introduction to Python (Part II) course*. You don't need to print or download anything if you got the binder with the course printed materials along with the flash-drive with the electronic materials and installers. The printed materials were sent for your comfort, you could use them in electronic format as well during the workshop, but it may be distracting from the class. In case there was an error, you didn't got them, you have to change between operating systems, or any other reason, **feel free to use this GITHUB and download the materials you need.**

**You can download any materials by clicking on the green button that says "code" in the top right corner above the listed folders and files. You'll see the option to download its contents as a zip file.**

#### Make sure you have all the materials at hand by the beginning of the workshop, either their printed or electronic versions.
#### We encourage you to install all the required software prior the beginning of the workshop.
#### You will see a folder with some short installation instructions. Feel free to contact us at compscibio2020@gmail.com if you have any issues with the installation process.
##### *All software is free or have a student version available, you don't have to pay for anything*
##### *All newer Macs (2016-present) are 64 bit. The majority of windows computers are also 64 bit (it is a requirement for computers with 4 GB of RAM or more)*

### Python and Wing
*Courses requiring them*: Introduction to Python (Part I and II)

You can download **Python** from the [python webpage](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384/). This link will direct you to the **python version 3.8.4** download page. Go to the end and you will see a *files* section. Click on the link according to your operating system.

You can download **Wing** from the [wing webpage](https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-personal). Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system. Wing is a software that allows us to access and work with the python language in a more organized way (similar to what Rstudio does with R).
