#### GETTING A SCRIPT FROM A COLLEAGUE ####
#You will be running this script on the horned lizard csv file, but you will need to modify to fit your data.
# paste and modify the script from your colleague here

# answer the following questions:
# 1) You should first understand what PCA is and does. Why don't you google it
# 2) Again, what question are you trying to answer?
# 3) What pieces of data did your colleague say you would need?
# 4) the object RECORDS is your csv file. How does the object LONGLAT differ from RECORDS?
# 5) What is the object VARIABLES and where did you get those data from?
# 6) What does the 'extract' function do?
# 7) What function performs the PCA?
# 8) What is the GROUP object for?
# 9) How do I change color on the graph?
# 10) How do I get rid of the arrows? They are distracting!
# 11) What do you conclude with respect to your objective?












#### HOW TO ANALYZE MY DATA? ####
# Do this if you are done with the previous section
# we have now visualized how the climatic conditions occupied by three species differ. 
# But are these differences significant? Can we run an analysis to test for that?
