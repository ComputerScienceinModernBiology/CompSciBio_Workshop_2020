Welcome to our workshop's Github!

As you may know, this year Miami University (MU) and the University of Oklahoma (OU) had allied to give you a broader range of introductory and advanced courses, covering several topics on **Computer Science in Modern Biology**. To the students that registered for classes before the deadline, we sent by mail the printed materials and a flash-drive containing the electronic resources and installers needed for each course. In this github page you will be able to access those materials electronically, in case you prefer it or you have not received the mailed materials yet.

#### Make sure you have all the materials at hand by the beginning of the workshop, either their printed or electronic versions.
#### We encourage you to install all the required software prior the beginning of the workshop.
#### You will see a folder with some short installation instructions. Feel free to contact us at compscibio2020@gmail.com if you have any issues with the installation process.
##### *All software is free or have a student version available, you don't have to pay for anything*
##### *All newer Macs (2016-present) are 64 bit. The majority of windows computers are also 64 bit (it is a requirement for computers with 4 GB of RAM or more)*

### R and Rstudio
*Courses requiring them*: Introduction to R (part I and part II), Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM Pikas and Beetles), Loops and Functions in R, Data Management, Data Visualization, Advanced GIS, and Conservation Biology.

You can download **R** from the [r-project webpage](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Make sure you install it before Rstudio. Download the appropriate version for your Operating System.

You can download **Rstudio** from the [Rstudio webpage](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Rstudio requires a valid R installation. In simple terms, it will give R a new and more easy to organize look. We generally use Rstudio as a way to work with R. Again, download and install the proper version according to your operating system.

### Java JDK (Java Development Kit)
*Courses requiring it*: Ecological Niche Modeling (Pikas and Beetles), Loops and Functions in R, Advanced GIS

You can download the **Java JDK** from the [Oracle webpage](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html). This module is required by R to read and create different types of files (like excel datasets and maps), and run *MAXENT* (essential for the ENM courses). Make sure you download and install the appropriate version for your operative system.

### Python and Wing
*Courses requiring them*: Introduction to Python (Part I and II)

You can download **Python** from the [python webpage](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384/). This link will direct you to the **python version 3.8.4** download page. Go to the end and you will see a *files* section. Click on the link according to your operating system.

You can download **Wing** from the [wing webpage](https://wingware.com/downloads/wing-personal). Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system. Wing is a software that allows us to access and work with the python language in a more organized way (similar to what Rstudio does with R).

### QGIS (Quantum GIS)
*Courses requiring it*: Introduction to GIS

You can download **QGIS** from the [QGIS webpage](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). Download and install the QGIS installer for your operating system.

### MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis)
*Courses requiring it*: Genes and Evolution (Evolutionary History)

You can download **MEGA** from the [MEGA software page](https://www.megasoftware.net/). Make sure you select the appropriate operating system version for downloading and installing in your computer.

### NoMachine, MobaXterm (windows), and Filezilla (Mac)
*Courses requiring it*: Introduction to HPC (High Performance Computing - MU only).

You can download **NoMachine** from the [NoMachine webpage](https://www.nomachine.com/). This software will allow you to access the MU HPC cluster, and work on it as you normally would on a desktop or laptop. If you are in this course, your miami ID was already granted access to the cluster. You'll learn how to configure it and more througout the course.

If you have Windows, you can download **MobaXterm** from the [MobaXterm webpage](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html). Download the installer edition.

If you have Mac, you can download **Filezilla** from the [Filezilla webpage](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx). This can also be installed in windows.

**MobaXterm and Filezilla** will allow you to access and transfer files from the HPC cluster. You'll learn how to configure them througout the course.
