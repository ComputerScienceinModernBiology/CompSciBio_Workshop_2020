# Workshop: Computer Science in Modern Biology

Welcome to our workshop Github!

As you know, this year Miami University (MU) and the University of Oklahoma (OU) had allied to give you a broader range of introductory and advanced courses, covering several topics on **Computer Science in Modern Biology**. To the students that registered for classes before the deadline, we sent by mail the printed materials and a flash-drive containing the electronic resources and installers needed for each course. In this github page you will be able to access those materials electronically, in case you prefer it or you have not received the mailed materials yet.

## We encourage you to install all the required software prior the beginning of the workshop.
